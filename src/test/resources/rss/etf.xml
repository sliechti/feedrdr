            <title> MARKET WEEK RALLY ENDS MIXED</title>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Earnings reports were mixed overall this week. Some companies have beaten much lowered estimates while others either missed or reported in-line results. Home builder D.R. Horton (DHI) results were stronger lifting the homebuilder sector (ITB) while disappointments were reflected in Altera (ALTR) and Amazon (AMZN), which held back tech (QQQ).</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Economic data remains weak as GDP Data missed and came in at 2.5% vs. 3.2% expected, and prior 0.4%. Most of the gains were in consumer spending spurred primarily by higher gas prices, student loans and auto lending with the latter expanding bubbles. Most disappointments were in inventory and fixed investments.  Consumer Sentiment fell to a three-month low to 76.4 vs. 78.6 expected.</span></div>

            <title>BULLS IGNORE ECONOMIC DATA</title>
            <link>http://etfdigest.com/davesdaily/?article=3085</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="4-24-2013 5-34-05 PM ignorance" src="http://etfdigest.com/images/stories/4-24-2013_5-34-05_PM_ignorance.jpg" height="325" width="406" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Durable Goods Orders laid an egg Wednesday showing severe declines, -5.7% vs -2.8% expected, and prior revised lower from 5.7% to 4.3%.  Ex-transportation data came in at -1.4% vs 0.5% expected, and prior revised down to -1.7% from -1.5%. But then again, economic data means nothing to a QE/ZIRP-addicted market where bad news is either shrugged off or regarded as good for those so addicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">The financial media can spin earnings any way they like but good earnings by those methods is rooted in “beats” of much lowered estimates. The following graph from the S&P shows the real earnings trend based on operating earnings over the past two years. Of course, “operating” earnings are different from “reported” earnings, which exclude some expense and other adjustments. Old-fashioned investors care about this while those operating algos and

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Most financial news that’s fit to print was a disappointment on Tuesday. Economic data from global PMI Manufacturing Indexes was weak and showing economic contraction as widespread: China PMI 50.5 vs 51.6; Europe PMI 46.5 vs 46.8; and, U.S. PMI 52 vs 54.9. In the UK, manufacturing data was at -25. The U.S. Richmond Fed Survey was -2 vs 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">New Home Sales missed estimates but rose from last report: 417K vs 419K expected, and prior, 411K. Under closer inspection, you'll note that data for new home prices were weaker by 6.8%. The FHFA Home Price Index met expectations and overall rose from last report: 0.7% vs. 0.7% expected, and prior, 0.6%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Taken together the economic data was quite weak. But this is set against a backdrop of global central bank money printing and

            <title>MAKING SENSE OF THINGS FOR INVESTORS</title>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Sometimes things just become obvious. Like you, we spend time trying to understand why markets are behaving as they are. But, at the end of the quest for the "why" of things is simply a waste of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">According to the chart below, courtesy of Gluskin Sheff’s David Rosenberg, stocks have rallied dollar for dollar with Fed QE since 2009. Hell, even a caveman could do it given this simplicity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">After we view the daily decline in U.S. economic data and see Europe in recession, China’s economy contracting (Fitch Moody’s lowered growth ratings), declines in commodity prices and wonder "why" stocks would rise at all. </span></p>

            <title>OPTIONS EXPIRATION MARKET DISTORTIONS</title>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">There was little in the way of economic data Friday but primarily there was the earnings hangover from IBM (negative) and beats from GOOG and MSFT. The latter allowed a rally Friday in the tech laden (QQQ) but really the poor IBM report should dominate tech. But IBM’s report only modestly held back the price-weighted DJIA as Boeing (BA) rallied. BA reported it had solved the Dreamliner’s battery problems. At the same time the company stated it was reducing plane order estimates which aren’t bullish right? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">With stocks short-term oversold it certainly wasn’t much of a surprise that options expiration Friday could manipulate volume and performance. Da Boyz in the options pits (mostly electronic now) were hunting down strike prices to exercise existing options as they can. It’s a technical event with an outcome

            <title>BIG EARNINGS AFTER THE CLOSE  FTW</title>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Markets are getting short-term oversold so leave it to some big three earnings reports to save Wall Broad. Oh wait; it’s just the computers somewhere.  Microsoft (MSFT) earnings reported revenue of $20.49 billion, est. $20.47 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) was 72 cents versus estimated 67 cents; Google (GOOG) reported 1Q revenue ex-TAC of $11.01 billion, lower than estimated $11.2 billion; EPS was $9.94 versus $8.83; and big-daddy International Business Machines (IBM) reported revenue at $23.41 billion versus the expected $24.62 billion, and  EPS $3.00 versus expected $3.06. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">In summary, Google only paid 8% tax vs 18% previous quarters, MSFT guided lower and IBM missed. Early after the close of trading MSFT GOOG shares are modestly higher while IBM is down sharply initially.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Markets fell hard once again Wednesday as it was feared Germany might be downgraded. (Later it was as Egan-Jones downgraded it from A+ to A) Further the eurozone overall seems to be coming back to haunt us…again. The drawn out end to debt and growth problems in the EU is made worse by stalling, other opaque methods and buying time operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Politically in the U.S., the eurozone, Japan and other countries (China last night) are addicted to QE ZIRP policies. But let’s face it; these policies have only worked to raise stock prices that have been a solo act. The Fed’s Beige Book just released admits the only source of economic growth is from subprime auto loans and low interest rate subsidized housing. This is the result of trillions spent or squandered in this

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Monday was financially grim and a tragic day. Tuesday gave investors the opportunity to rally stocks even as news overall wasn’t overwhelming supportive. The CPI at -.02% reflects deflation but Housing Starts improved to 1.04 million vs 917K previously. However little noticed under the hood on the housing data was most was in multi-family housing vs single family homes. This helped REITs (IYR) and homebuilders (ITB). Industrial Production was just okay (.4% vs .7%) previously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">It wouldn’t surprise you much that Goldman Sachs (GS) earnings beat estimates ($4.29 vs $3.87 expected) but that is how they play the game. On the other hand, Target (TGT) warned it would achieve estimates. More curious was the financial engineering trick achieved by Coke (KO) which beat estimates after a large amount of “one-time” charges and with news

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">It appears that despite <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/pomo/display/index.cfm">POMO</a> ($5.6 billion Monday), economic data is making a negative impact. Last night China’s GDP data disappointed (7.7% vs 8% expected) and Industrial Production declined (8.9% vs 10% expected). In the U.S. the Empire State Mfg Survey dropped (3.05 vs 7.50 expected prior 9.24) and the Housing Market Index (42 vs 45 expected prior 44). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Then there’s the carnage in gold (GLD) and other commodity markets (DBC). This action has been the canary in the coal mine building for equity markets. Why? Poor global economic data has been building for months and commodities have foretold the tale. Yet at the same time, investors have ignored this in favor of the QE/ZIRP momentum trade in equities. </span></p>
