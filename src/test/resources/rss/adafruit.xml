<p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1278">NEW PRODUCT &#8211; BeagleBone Black in stock and shipping!</a> We have them here and these ship immediately while they are in stock. If you liked the BeagleBone, you will love the next gen BeagleBone Black! With a blistering 1GHz processor, 512MB onboard DDR3 RAM, built in 2GB storage with pre-installed Linux operating system (no microSD card required!), and best of all, the addition of a MicroHDMI connector for audio/video output. This is a ultra-powered embedded computer that can fit in a mint tin. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1278"><img src="http://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1278scale_LRG.jpg" height="461" width="600" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="1278Scale Lrg" /></a></p>

<p>Comes with a mini B cable for powering it up ASAP. No microSD card is included as the BBB now has onboard flash storage. </p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be filling in with more information on supported accessories as we test them for compatibility. For now we suggest picking up a 5V 2A power supply and a micro-HDMI cable. If you want to use it &#8216;head-less&#8217;, a USB console cable is suggested as the &#8216;Black does not have an onboard USB-to-Serial converter like the original BeagleBone.</p>

<p><a href="http://nesit.org/projects/">The NESIT Raspberry Pi RFID Automated Door Access System</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This project came out of necessity. With the amount of members we have, it made more sense to make an automated door access system, than to give everyone keys. We originally used an Arduino for the last 2 years, but we wanted to be able to control the database of users easier, our current setup wrote the users to the eeprom of the Arduino. We were thinking about using an ethernet module to talk with a server on our network but if our network had issues that would prevent someone from entering. The small footprint of the Pi makes it a better choice than to run a server fulltime. Our modest server burns through around $200 a year worth of electricity. By comparison a Raspberry Pi consumes about $3 per year. With the Raspberry Pi we could now have ethernet capabilities, could store its own database, gpio pins , video output and more.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Starting the project I needed to figure out how to interface a RFID reader with the Pi. I wanted to interface it with the UART pins but due to time constraints I ended up using a sparkfun USB adapter with my Innovations ID-20 RFID reader. The only thing I has to do was monitor the USB in /dev and receive the RFID tag ID when someone scanned their card. To do this I used python script that monitored serial connection on /dev/ttyUSB0 the base of the script which I have posted to my github account and used a sqlite3 database to verify if the card scanned was a valid member, if so it would trigger the door. Also used a RGB LED to notify if the card was good or not.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was recently interviewed by PBS Off Book for this episode, <a href="http://youtu.be/4qFW4zwXzLs">The Future of Wearable Technology</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>As computing moves from our desktops to our phones, we look into the future to see how technology will become increasingly ingrained in our movements and our active lives. From the Nike Fuelband to Google Glass, consumers are already seeing hints of the future of wearable devices. They have the possibility to make us more knowledgeable about ourselves and our surroundings, and connect us with each other in an uninterrupted, more intimate way. From DIY wearables to high-tech sensors and smart fabrics, the years ahead will show how integrated technology can impact our lives for the better.</p>
<p>Featuring: Sandy Pentland, MIT<br />Sabine Seymour, Parsons<br /> Steven Dean, G51Studio<br /> Becky Stern, Adafruit</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://americangraphitetechnologies.com/">American Graphite Technologies Inc</a>. (OTCBB: AGIN), a mineral exploration and technology development company, announces Letter of Intent with a European institute for research and development collaboration for 3D printing.</p>
<p>American Graphite Technologies, in collaboration with the National Academy of Science of Ukraine; National Science Centre; Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology (&#8220;KIPT&#8221;), Kharkov, Ukraine, will research the properties of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene">graphene</a> contained matter as working material for 3D printing. More details will be released shortly.</p>
<p>Graphene is a nano-material directly derived from graphite. It is a single layer of carbon only one atom thick, and it is very cheap. Graphene has been described as the &#8220;miracle material&#8221; of the 21st Century. According to mechanical engineering professor James Hone, of Columbia University, graphene is strongest material ever measured, some 200 times stronger than structural steel.</p>
<p>In addition, Graphene is ultra thin, transparent, flexible and electrically conductive. Because of these remarkable properties Graphene can be used to make excellent transistors, gas sensors, lower cost solar cells and display screens in mobile devices etc.</p>
<p>Watch [above] the short film produced by the European Graphene-Flagship initiative, &#8220;introducing graphene&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gorgeous object highlighted on the <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/2031-3D-Printed-Product-of-the-Day-Darwins-Cladogram-Tree.html">Shapeways blog</a> created from drawings from Darwin&#8217;s Cladogram Tree map of the relationship of the finches that were key to the formulation of his theory of evolution:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you&#8217;re fascinated by evolution theories or not, check out this amazing <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/model/999231/darwin-s-cladogram-tree-with-finches.html">replication</a> of Charles Darwin&#8217;s first ever sketch of a tree of life by <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/joabaldwin">joabaldwin</a>.</p>
<p>The detailed replication pays homage to Darwin&#8217;s original sketch found in his private notebook, &#8220;Notebook B on the transmutation of species,&#8221; 1837-1838.</p>
<p>The finches perched upon the end of each branch represent the A, B, C and D marks on the original drawing. Each is slightly different; the more apart the finches are from each other in the evolutionary tree, the more distinct are the differences between them.</p>
<p>From a side view, the shape of the printed tree mirrors Darwin&#8217;s sketch exactly.</p>
<p>This fantastic piece also comes in the form of a <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/model/971216/darwin-s-silver-cladogram-tree.html?li=productBox-search">necklace</a>.</p>
<p>As taken from Darwin&#8217;s notebook itself, &#8220;I think &#8230; Case must be that one generation then should be as many living as now. To do this and to have many species in same genus (as is) requires extinction. Thus between A &#038; B immense gap of relation. C &#038; B the finest gradation, B &#038; D rather greater distinction. Thus genera would be formed.—bearing relation.&#8221;

<p>Check out these great resources from the <a href="http://richrap.blogspot.de/2013/04/3d-printing-with-nylon-618-filament-in.html">RichRap blog</a> for learning about Taluman Nylon 618 print material and how to dye it!</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://taulman3d.com/index.html">Taluman Nylon 618</a> is a very versatile printing material. Nylon does not require a heated bed, has low warp, and cooling fans are not required for both big or tiny printing.</p>
<p>You can print big and really tiny things in Nylon. No fans or heated beds required! Nylon has amazing self-bonding properties making any FFF (layer-by-layer) printed objects very strong and less prone to de-lamination. Another aspect of its development was the ability to colour the Nylon with fabric Dye. That hits almost every spot for me!</p>
<p>From the moment I spotted the 618 Nylon was available I wanted to try colouring the raw filament with more than one colour, something I have always wanted manufacturers to make is a range of filaments that have changes of colour during the roll or even across the roll, now I had a way to do it myself.</p>
<p>Taulman 3D recommends printing with the natural filament and then dyeing the parts afterwards for best results, but I wanted to see what happened when dyeing the filament first as that sounded a lot more fun…. </p></blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s a cool passive sound amplification project for the iPhone from a talented middle schooler, shared by the <a href="http://cubify.com/blog/3d-printing-kids-cad-henry-makes-an-annoyinator/">Cubify</a> blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Henry, a middle school student, has a natural talent for design. He has learned CAD this semester and has produced a cool design.</p>
<p>Coming back from Easter Break, Henry brought his latest creation, The Annoyinator.</p>
<p>As Henry explains it, The Annoyinator is designed to amplify the output of an i-Pod and to make that output directional. The core science is the passive amplification available via an acoustic horn (like an old Victrola) coupled some directional capabilities. With some help from his dad, an audio guy, Henry took the dimensions of an i-Pod and started to design.</p>
<p>Henry wanted a device that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Securely hold the i-Pod</li>
<li>Allow access to the controls</li>
<li>Provide passive amplification (look ma, no batteries)</li>
<li>Allow for directional projection of annoying noise</li>
</ul>
<p>“The tolerances and clearances in The Annoyinator are excellent. It holds my i-Pod snugly and still allows access to the controls,” Henry said.</p>
<p>The design also works in terms of Henry&rsquo;s audio goals as it amplifies the small internal speaker in the i-Pod and gives significant directionality to the sounds being played (Henry favors the high-pitched mosquito drone). </p>
<p>The Irritator is constructed of several pieces and printed on a Cube II printer. The neon orange color allows for easy location of The Irritator in a crowded backpack or desk. </p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/midas-touch.png" alt="Midas touch" title="midas-touch.png" border="0" width="558" height="280" /></p>
<p>From the perspective of art restoration and research, all paintings are sculptural artifacts &#8212; with laters of pigment piled up in a particular stroke order of touches by brush, pallet knife, drip, etc.. But while this may be the case, this tactile information tends to be available only to the visual scanning and topology instruments and not to the humans standing near to them &#8212; for rather obvious reasons. </p>
<p>No one is going to let you touch masterworks of oil or acrylic because the oils in your hands and the friction of your fingertips have the potential to damage or change the surface of the work. However, take a look at this project Midas Touch &#8212; which approaches the task of transforming the 2.5D sculptural potential of visual artworks even further to help provide safe &#8220;tactile-viewing&#8221; replicas of this fragile work by running computer graphics processes to generate a 3D printable model of works of visual art for the visually impaired. From <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/16/midas-touch-harvard-3d-printing-blind/">Venture Beat</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>For the visually impaired, the basic problem with art is that they can&rsquo;t see it. But with a project called “Midas Touch” a group of Harvard kids say they have a fix: Use 3D printing to help the blind “see” what they cannot actually see.</p>
<p>“We want to bridge the gap between the visually impaired and the visual world of art,” Constantine Tarabanis, one of the brains behind the project, told me.</p>
<p>Basically, what Midas Touch does is take a flat image — say, of “Starry Night” — and use 3D printing to add layers of texture to it, creating an image that&rsquo;s half painting, half relief sculpture. Essentially, Midas Touch takes the visual nature of art and translates it to a physical world that the visually impaired can understand.</p>
<p>In theory, anyway. The thing to keep in mind with Midas Touch is that the whole project is at this point a concept. While Tarabanis and his team have a great idea and a bunch of funding, they&rsquo;re still working on creating working prototypes to prove their idea has legs.</p>
<p>As result, its a bit tough to fully understand or even convey what we&rsquo;re talking about here — and somehow, I&rsquo;m fine with that: In fact, the inability to describe Midas Touch is in its own way a meta-reference to what the project is trying to accomplish. How do you understand something that you can&rsquo;t see? &#8230;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Lego-school-010.jpg" height="276" width="460" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Lego-School-010" /></p>
<p><a href="http://m.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/apr/22/lego-school-building-learning">Lego school promises the building blocks to successful learning</a> &#8211; Danish firm brings its research into child development as well as cash to new Billund venture centred on inquiry-based education&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>
For many children, it&#8217;s the ultimate fantasy. For a few, it&#8217;s about to become a reality. In August a newly refurbished building in Billund, Denmark, will open its doors to become the first ever &#8220;Lego school&#8221;.<br />
The fee-paying establishment is the brainchild of the toy manufacturer&#8217;s billionaire owner, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, who hopes the school will help put the town in rural Jutland – a place Copenhageners refer to as Hicksville – on the map as the Capital of Children.</p>
<p>The International School of Billund will combine the international baccalaureate (IB) with the Danish school system and Lego&#8217;s emphasis on creativity and play. Centred around &#8220;inquiry-based learning&#8221;, the idea is that children are more motivated when they generate their own questions. As one prospective parent of the new school put it: &#8220;In the UK you&#8217;re taught how to pass exams. In Scandinavia you&#8217;re taught how to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school&#8217;s champions hope that by combining this free and easy approach to learning with Lego&#8217;s research into child development and the international baccalaureate, pupils will have the tools to both &#8220;think&#8221; and &#8220;do&#8221; in their chosen careers.</p>
<p>The headteacher is British physicist-turned-international-school-tsar Richard Matthews, a seasoned head, having led schools all over the world from Botswana to Grimsby. As one of the few men in Denmark to wear a tie, he is referred to by some prospective parents as &#8220;Tie Man&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allowing time for creativity, play and getting into a state of flow is at the centre of Lego&#8217;s philosophy and we&#8217;ll be experimenting with this and other ideas in the timetabling,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we also have a responsibility — the children&#8217;s education comes first and sometimes the old methods will be the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UK debate about child-centred learning was revived on Monday when Liz Truss, the early years minister, complained to the Daily Mail that in nurseries she had &#8220;seen too many chaotic settings, where children are running around&#8221; in an environment with &#8220;no sense of purpose&#8221;.

<p>Belgian designer and engineer Carl de Smet is experimenting with a kind of smart foam technology, which he believes could do just that.</p>
<p>Once heated to a set temperature, the material he works with, shape memory polyurethane (SMPU), will expand to a given design.</p>
<p>Currently working with scaled-down models, de Smet is close to building the technology to achieve the effect with full-size furniture.

<p>A short opinions piece from Forbes that makes a good point about grade school kids and creativity. From <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kaifalkenberg/2013/04/24/my-kindergartner-can-3d-print-so-can-yours/">Forbes.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Experts like Joris Peels, <a href="http://www.origo3dprinting.com/">creator of the first 3D printer for children,</a> agrees that grade school kids are ideally suited to the brave new world of 3D printing.  Why?  Because they&rsquo;re the most creative.  As he explained recently in a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22093072">BBC interview</a>: “Children make a lot of things but as we hit our teens we make less…  We become afraid of designing.  We hit that blank canvas problem and think ‘what am I going to make?&rsquo; We are basically very lazy creatures.”</p>
<p>Blank canvases are certainly not a problem for my kids and the others participating in the 3D printing workshop that I&rsquo;ve been hosting at my apartment these past few weekends.  Run by digital fabrication expert <a href="http://dfmsummit.com/speaker/arthuryoungspivey/">Arthur Young-Spivey</a>, the kids are learning several highly intuitive 3D modeling software programs.  Among them is Sculptris, a program that allows users to digitally sculpt objects onscreen  — virtually molding it like a piece of clay.  Last week, the kids experimented with <a href="http://www.doodle3d.com/">Doodle3D</a>, the sketching tool that brings 2D drawings to life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/companje/doodle3d">Doodle3D</a> was the breakaway hit at <a href="http://3dea.openhouse.me/3dea/">3DEA</a>, the 3D printing pop-up store in midtown Manhattan where I met Arthur in February.   Created by Dutch developer Rick Companje, the software is amazingly simple to use.  You just draw a sketch on a computer or tablet, click print, and the attached printer turns it into a 3D object.</p>
<p>Doodle3D and <a href="http://pixologic.com/sculptris/">Sculptris</a> are among the growing number of kid-friendly programs that don&rsquo;t require knowledge of sophisticated modeling software.  One app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lets-create!-pottery-hd/id380090605?mt=8">Lets Create!</a>, recently <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2013/03/12/3d-printed-pottery-from-your-mobile-phone/">featured on Forbes</a>, lets you design and paint pottery that you can have 3D printed and mailed to you.  Another site, <a href="http://cubify.com/store/3dme.aspx">3DMe</a>, lets kids create 3D printed action figures that look just like themselves….</p></blockquote>

Installation, 102 x 940 mm, 2011. The broken image icon is to replace an image that failed to load or is missing, which is used only in cyber space and has no reason to exist in physical reality. Through this installation, I tried to crack the border between them by transferring the symbol from one world to another world. I am wondering how people will react to the broken image icons in the real stuff. Will they feel blankness and imagine missing images, focusing on its original information, or will they accept them as just small images?

My goal was to come up with a way to clean the pool without killing my hands and arms as I have in years past without spending a trillion bucks. </p>
<p>The solution I came up with is a light-weight extension to a common hand-drill (and drill would do) and using a shoulder strap for ergonomics. I had some spare pistol-grips laying around that I wasn&#8217;t going to use, so I bolted 3 of them onto the Channel to create multiple holding options (3D printed handles would work even better!). This way I can brush the floor while standing upright, and yet brush the walls while holding the tool closer to me with a shoulder strap, all without generating nearly the fatigue that I have in the past using other methods.

The deadline is 6pm ET, 5/6/13. The Adafruit team of judges will pick their favorites and announce the winner on May, 12th at 6pm ET.</p>
<p>tl;dr &#8211; Post a 6 second video of your electronic project(s) using <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23adafruit6secs&#038;src=typd">Vine on Twitter and tag it #adafruit6secs</a> !</p>
<p>Keep reading for all the details!</p>
<h1>STEP ONE: MAKE A 6 SECOND VIDEO, PLEASE USE VINE!</h1>
<p>The easiest way to make a 6 second video for The Adafruit 6 second electronics film festival is to use Vine. If you don&#8217;t have an iOS device, no big deal &#8211; most everything can take 6 second videos and upload. With Vine and looping a 6 second video you can make cool videos that repeat what you&#8217;ve made that&#8217;s blinking, moving or making noise &#8211; get creative, and enter as often as you&#8217;d like. Make sure you do not use any copyrighted music, video, etc. This should be your cool project you are sharing, in 6 seconds.</p>
<h1>STEP TWO: TAG THE VIDEO with #adafruit6secs</h1>
<p>The most important thing is to tag the video with #adafruit6secs . We&#8217;ll be mostly using Twitter to find most of these, you can also send a link to your video via the contact form (do not email us video files!).</p>
<h1>STEP THREE: POST TO TWITTER, G+, YOUTUBE, ETC.</h1>
<p>Post your tagged <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23adafruit6secs&#038;src=typd">6 second video from Vine</a> or on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23adafruit6secs">Youtube</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/s/%23adafruit6secs">Google+</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%23adafruit6secs">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23adafruit6secs&#038;src=typd">Twitter (Vine can post to Twitter)</a> just make sure it&#8217;s easily searchable on those services by tagging it with <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23adafruit6secs&#038;src=typd">#adafruit6secs</a> .</p>
<h1>STEP FOUR: THERE IS NO STEP 4!</h1>
<p>That&#8217;s it!</p>
<h1>PRIZES: $600 GRAND PRIZE, SIX $60 PRIZES (ADAFRUIT STORE)</h1>
<p>The team of Adafruit judges will pick our favorites. Grand prize is a $600 gift certificate in the Adafruit store and six runners-up will receive $60 in store credit each. THE DEADLINE IS 6:00 PM ON MONDAY 5/6/13!</p>
<p>Make sure to tag &amp; upload by 6pm ET, Monday, May 6th, 2013, that&#8217;s the deadline.</p>
<h1>WINNERS ANNOUNCED LIVE ON ASK AN ENGINEER: 5/12/13!</h1>
<p>We will play the videos on <a href="http://adafruit.com/ask/">ASK AN ENGINEER</a> Saturday night 10pm ET on May 12th, 2013.

<p>Perhaps I was initially a bit of a victim of link-baiting, I found this article about the real-world Organovo organ bioprinter pretty hilarious, as well as sharing the breaking news about the &#8220;mini-livers.&#8221; From <a href="http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=59D4CE40-93A0-88CC-BBE5C7A69BC07D34">IDG</a>, via <a href="http://linkpuls.idg.no/go/e/page_news/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23419-3d-printer-makes-tiniest-human-liver-ever.html">New Scientist</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p>At this week&#8217;s annual Experimental Biology conference in Boston, California-based <a href="http://linkpuls.idg.no/go/e/page_news/http://www.organovo.com/">Organovo</a> announced that it&#8217;s one step closer to <a href="http://linkpuls.idg.no/go/e/page_news/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23419-3d-printer-makes-tiniest-human-liver-ever.html">3D-printing a functional human liver</a> for transplants.</p>
<p>In fact, the scientists over at Organovo already made a human liver in the lab that can perform most of the tasks that an in-body liver can perform. Unfortunately, it also happens to be the smallest human liver ever&#8211;only a millimeter deep and four millimeters across. As you can imagine, it&#8217;s not really big enough for your average human body.</p>
<p>The liver was &#8220;built&#8221; using a 3D printer loaded up with human cells. The printer assembles these cells the same way a normal 3D printer uses plastic, layering them into a final form. All told, Organovo&#8217;s mini-livers contain approximately 20 layers of cells, including some taken from blood vessels. The blood vessel cells are especially important, as they allow the mini-liver to take in nutrients and stay alive for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Even though you can&#8217;t use these mini-livers for transplants, they do have a broad range of applications in the lab. Because Organovo&#8217;s livers function almost exactly like real human livers, they could help scientists test the effects of drugs on the human body. The mini-livers also produce the same compounds as a real liver, including cytochrome P450s, used by the body for drug metabolism and detoxification.</p>
<p>The next challenge for Organovo is to figure out how to print a larger support structure for blood vessels&#8211;essential if we&#8217;re ever going to get full-sized 3D-printed livers suitable for human transplant….</p>
<p>Still, not too long ago 3D printers were just assembling small plastic prototypes. Next it was guns, and now organs. Science seems destined to bring me to a future where I can indeed abuse my body as much as I want with no repercussions, and I can&#8217;t wait.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lately on Thingiverse, thanks to <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/cymon/designs/">Cymon</a> and <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/pp3dpNL/designs">pp3dpNL</a>, there have been a number of fun printed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithophane">lithophanes</a> projects appearing. Here is a post from <a href="http://joesmakerbot.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-to-make-lithophanes.html">Cymon&#8217;s blog</a> about how to make them for yourself!</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been having a blast figuring out lithophanes and working out how to best make them. I think I&#8217;m going to start offering custom lithophane services in the store, which technically means I shouldn&#8217;t give away how I&#8217;m making them&#8230; but that&#8217;s not the sort of guy I am.</p>
<p>First thing I discovered is the local dollar store sells nightlights that I can print a holder for that will illuminate the lithophanes really well.</p>
<p>Another things I discovered was about thickness. From left to right (1) the source picture (my daughter), (2) white at 3mm thick, (3) tan at 3mm thick, (4) tan at 2.5mm thick. I thought I needed to make it thicker so I could have more color depth. Since I print these laying down I only get as many shades as I have layers. And sure enough if I want more layers I have to print in white, the tan just doesn&#8217;t let enough light through. But after comparing them side by side I really prefer the sepia-tone look of the tan ones. The white looks better in the picture, but in real life the tan is just superior. And at 2.5mm thick I&#8217;m getting about 16 layers, so that&#8217;s enough color for anything.</p>
<p>If you would like to make your own just follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://geisel.ba-bautzen.de/bmp2iges.htm">Download BMPtoIGES</a></li>
<li>Choose a source image with good contrast.</li>
<li>Scale the picture to about 800&#215;600 (the more pixels the more points in the final mesh the harder to process)</li>
<li>In BMPtoIGES load your picture</li>
<li>Set your edgecolor to black (so the holder has something to hold on to)</li>
<li>Enter the following settings:<br />
<blockquote><p><img src="http://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NewImage5.png" alt="NewImage" title="NewImage.png" border="0" width="314" height="157" /></p></blockquote>
<li>File->Save and Process, choose STL and save your file</li>
<li>Import the STL in Blender or your favorite mesh editing program</li>
<li>Scale the STL by 50% in the Z only (I suppose you could change the 75 to 150 and just scale in all directions by 50%)</li>
<li>Slice and print (I like to lay mine down. That works pretty well in my experience)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Z-scaling is because I don&#8217;t think BMPtoIGES likes decimals in its boxes. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m really surprised at how easy the process is&#8230; once I figured everything out. There was a lot of experimentation to get here, but in the end I&#8217;m fairly satisfied with the results. So don&#8217;t let my suffering be in vain and enjoy making your own Lithophanes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Check out this article over at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/24/3d-printed-food_n_3148598.html">Huffington Post</a> covering <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2011/10/24/jeffrey-lipton-of-fabhome-on-3d-printing/">Jeffrey Lipton</a>&#8216;s talk at Inside 3D Printing on Tuesday: &#8220;<a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/inside3dprinting/agenda_day2.asp">Digital Cuisine: Bringing 3D Printing to the Cooking Realm</a>.&#8221; This was one of my favorite sessions at the conference, and I enjoyed standing by after the talk while the article&#8217;s author followed up with Lipton to collect quotes and data for her article.</p>
<blockquote><p>These days, restaurant dishes can&rsquo;t be customized too far beyond requests to hold the dressing or to cook the meat medium-rare.</p>
<p>But thanks to 3D printing technology, along with the proliferation of sensors tracking our activities and tastes, future meals &#8212; even mass-produced ones &#8212; could be tailored specifically to suit an individual&rsquo;s dietary needs. A dish someone is served might even be calibrated to the calories she burned that day.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Lipton, a doctoral candidate at Cornell University&rsquo;s Creative Machines Lab and chief technology officer of Seraph Robotics, argues that the emerging category of data-driven food is destined to make up a much larger part of our diet in the years to come.</p>
<p>Lipton predicts that cloud computing, 3D printing and the explosion in digitized personal data will together allow for the mass customization of meals, letting chefs instantly produce dishes that offer the recommended quantities of sugar, fat or sodium when given diners&#8217; health records.</p>
<p>Instead of eating a quarter of a donut to cut calories, you instead might be able to buy a whole pastry from the corner deli, then watch the donut 3D printed before your eyes &#8212; with one-fourth the calories and just the right amount of fiber to bring you up to your daily minimum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you have the automatic collection of what you&rsquo;re eating and when, you can predict &#8212; based off your activity levels, your planned diet and your health records &#8212; exactly how much and what types of food you should be eating. That&rsquo;s really ultimately the long-term potential of food printing,&#8221; explained Lipton during a lecture at the Inside 3D Printing conference in New York City on Tuesday. &#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be about this automated production of food where you have the entire cloud of information helping to guide you forward.&#8221;<br />

<p>The model train company <a href="http://www.flexiscale.co/">Flexiscale</a> has adapted to the new 3D technologies available by inviting their customers to select subjects for them to then carefully 3D scan and 3D print &#8212; adding intricately precise scale model units with each new project.

<blockquote><p>Hello. We&#8217;re trying something new in model kits. The way we design them is different, the way they&#8217;re made is different and the way we choose which kits to make is different.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re using modern surveying methods on real life objects to make precise three dimensional plans. We split up the plans into kits that we feel are simple, yet fun to make, detail and paint. We&#8217;re producing the kits on demand using 3D printing.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ve worked out how to do it, what we want to do is to make the kits you want. So we&#8217;ve made a system for you to propose kits to us.</p></blockquote>

Every Thursday is <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/">#3dthursday</a> here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!</p>
<p>Have you considered building a 3D project around an <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/category/17">Arduino</a> or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/category/105">Raspberry Pi</a> to the back of your HD monitor? And don&#8217;t forget the countless <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/category/37">LED projects</a> that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com">Adafruit Learning System</a> has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you&#8217;ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/">feature</a> it here!</p>

<p>Exciting new developments from Zach Hoeken Smith&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hoektronics.com/2013/04/24/botqueue-v0-3-webcams-pausing-and-more/">BotQueue.com</a> project: &#8220;Webcams, Pausing, and More!&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Coming quickly on the heels of the <a href="http://www.hoektronics.com/2013/04/08/botqueue-update-raspberry-pi-temperature-dashboard/">last release</a>, the latest v0.3 release of BotQueue adds some really exciting new features that make it much nicer to use. I hope you enjoy this new version as much as I do. Be careful though, the new webcam feature is addictive – you can watch your machine from anywhere you have an internet connection and a display.</p>
<p>If you want to take advantages of the new BotQueue, you&rsquo;ll need to upgrade the BotQueue client, bumblebee. See instructions at the end of the article for how to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Webcam Support</strong></p>
<p>This is the biggest new feature for BotQueue, and the one that I&rsquo;m most excited about. The BotQueue client, Bumblebee, can now grab webcam images and upload them to the BotQueue site. This allows you to be able to see whats happening on your bot through the BotQueue.com website. That&rsquo;s right, you can see how your bot is printing from any device (computer, phone, tablet, etc) from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also modified the dashboard and various pages throughout the website to support showing the webcams. The default dashboard view is now large thumbnail images, although you can switch to medium, small, and the old list-style view of your bots. BotQueue will also save the final image of each job so you can have a historical view of how each print turned out. In the future, we&rsquo;ll even be able to automatically create timelapse videos of each job.</p>
<p>In order to add webcam support, please see the <a href="http://www.botqueue.com/help">help page</a> with information on how to configure bumblebee to start capturing and uploading webcam images….</p></blockquote>

Jason proposes to his girlfriend Christina at Alamo Square park in San Francisco on April 7th 2013. Jason told Christina that he wanted to take some photos of her in the park. During the photo session the engagement ring flies in on top of a small RC helicopter and he proposes to her on the spot. Jason was shooting with a 5D mark II. Two aerial cameras were used on the helicopter, a Gopro Hero 3 black and an 808 keychain camera. Additional ground footage shot with my 5D mark III.

<p><a href="http://geekdad.com/2013/04/a-big-congratulations-to-geekdads-ken-denmead/">A Big Congratulations to GeekDad&#8217;s Ken Denmead! @ GeekDad</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Ken has accepted a position as the Editorial Director of Make.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Make, here&rsquo;s a quick summary. Make is a magazine (both print and digital). It&rsquo;s also a blog – makezine.com. It has a retail arm — MakerShed. And it also just happens to be the host of an event that bills itself as The Greatest Show (and Tell) on Earth. And if you&rsquo;ve never attended a Maker Faire, you&rsquo;ll just have to take my word for it that it&rsquo;s two days you&rsquo;ll never forget.<br />
And Ken is now a part of that family.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for GeekDad? Well, it does mean a change in leadership. Ken will be stepping down as Editor-in-Chief, and taking charge will be Matt Blum. The writing staff at GeekDad isn&rsquo;t worried, and while we&rsquo;re all congratulating Ken, we&rsquo;re also congratulating Matt. As I told Ken in an email, he&rsquo;s now involved with two of my most favorite resources.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Big news in the maker world!</p>

<blockquote><p>
&#8216;Forest&#8217; is a large interactive musical laser installation. Commissioned by and premiered at the STRP Biennale in Eindhoven, this giant interactive forest covers almost 450 square meters and is composed of over 150 musical &#8216;trees&#8217; made of rods and lasers. The audience can freely explore the space, physically tapping, shaking, plucking, and vibrating the trees to trigger sounds and lasers. Due to the natural springiness of the material, interacting with the trees causes them to swing and oscillate, creating vibrating patterns of light and sound. Each tree is tuned to a specific tone, creating harmonious sounds spatialized and played through a powerful surround sound setup. </p>
<p>The installation is designed to bring out in adults those feelings of curiosity and wonderment which are so alive and evident in children.</p>
<p>Forest exists as a tourable interactive installation, open to the public, and also a performance. The performance premiered at the STRP Biennale opening, consisting of 12 local children between the age of 8 and 12 years old. They were choreographed to move around the space, strumming and triggering the lasers and sounds.

<p>While the LPC1769 doesn&#8217;t have the super-handy USB bootloader found on it&#8217;s newer, smaller cousin the LPC1347, it does still have a UART-based bootloader built into the ROM memory, so it&#8217;s almost impossible to brick the MCU.</p>
<p>The LPCXpresso board includes an on-board SWD/JTAG debugger than can be used to debug your LPC1769 project in NXP&#8217;s free LPCXpresso IDE (free for up to 128KB), but you can also debug the board with any other SWD or JTAG debugger using the optional SWD connector, or program the boards via the free Flash Magic tool or an open source utility like lpc2isp.</p>

<p>The LPC1769 isn&#8217;t the most beginner friendly devices out there, but for those of us who have microcontroller experience and want to step it up, they are an excellent introduction to proper embedded design and development. Given the popularity of these chips there are quite a few resources out there for them, such as ports of popular open source RTOSes like FreeRTOS, and stacks like LWIP or uIP.</p>
<p>Best of all, this is the same MCU that&#8217;s used on most of the mbed boards out there, and the mbed source code has recently been republished under an open source license, so you have a large pool of proven, well-thought-out code to take advantage of trying to build something amazing with this kitchen-sink of an MCU!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/1342"><img src="http://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1342_LRG-600x461.jpg" alt="" title="1342_LRG" width="600" height="461" class="alignright size-large wp-image-61429" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/1342">NEW PRODUCT &#8211; LPCXpresso LPC1347 Development Board with LPC-Link</a> &#8211; The LPC1347 LPCXpresso board is part of NXP&#8217;s LPCXpresso eco-system of low cost development boards based around the free (GCC and Eclipse-based) LPCXpresso IDE. All LPCXpresso boards include an on-board hardware SWD/JTAG debugger, so you don&#8217;t need any additional hardware (other than a USB mini-B cable) to start some serious debugging (including setting and stepping through breakpoints, etc.).</p>
<p>The LPCXpresso boards are actually two separate boards, and the debugger (called the LPC-Link) can actually be separated from the LPC1347 MCU half, but this is only useful if you plan to use the debugger with other boards inside the LPCXpresso IDE. The MCU side of the board breakout out every pin on the LPC1347, and is actually a really nice dev board because it&#8217;s so minimal! You can do what you want with the MCU, without all kinds of conflicts, and it comes in a pretty breadboard friendly size.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/1342"><img src="http://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1342bottom_LRG-600x461.jpg" alt="" title="1342bottom_LRG" width="600" height="461" class="alignright size-large wp-image-61432" /></a></p>
<p>This LPCXpresso is for the LPC1347:</p>
<ul>
<li>72MHz ARM Cortex-M3 MCU with 64 KB flash and 12 KB SRAM</li>
<li>Full-Speed (12Mb/s) USB 2.0, with ROM-based drivers for USB HID, MSC, CDC and DFU</li>
<li>Built in USB bootloader makes it easy to update the flash on any PC (no extra HW or SW required!)</li>
<li>4KB internal EEPROM</li>
<li>12-bit 500k sample/s ADC, 4 HW timers, 2 SPI ports, I2C, and USART</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking for an affordable general-purpose, USB-enabled MCU that packs a lot of punch in a small package? The LPC1347 is an excellent choice with a highly efficient ARM Cortex-M3 core at up to 72MHz, 64KB flash and 12KB SRAM. What makes it stand out in the crowd of small M3 MCUs? It has built in ROM-based USB drivers that make it relatively easy to implement USB, but more importantly it includes a super-handy USB bootloader that makes the device appear as a USB Mass Storage device with 64KB flash. To update your firmware, just drag and drop your binaries files onto the flash drive, reset, and voila &#8230; your device is programmed! No extra HW, no special software, and no worries about being able to de-brick your device in the future!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/1342"><img src="http://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1342isobottom_LRG-600x461.jpg" alt="" title="1342isobottom_LRG" width="600" height="461" class="alignright size-large wp-image-61433" /></a></p>
<p>In traditional Adafruit fashion, though, we wouldn&#8217;t just throw something fun at you and say &#8216;have at it!&#8217;. <a href="https://github.com/microbuilder/LPC11U_LPC13U_CodeBase">KTOWN has put together a completely open source code base for the LPC1347 (and it&#8217;s Cortex M0-based cousins the LPC11U24 and LPC11U37) that makes it easy to get started with this board and MCU from the command-line (using a Makefile), or with several modern IDEs (NXP&#8217;s free LPCXpresso IDE, Rowley Associates Crossworks for ARM, The free cross-platform CodeLite IDE, as well as experimental project files for Keil)</a>. The code base also includes drivers for a lot of popular Adafruit sensors, like the ADXL345, the BMP085, some OLED and graphic displays, and lot of other goodies!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to ARM, and need a bit of hand-holding to get started, this is probably the board you want to pick up: its got that nice built in USB boot-loader, lots of example code, GCC support and a debugger built in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/1342"><img src="http://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1342top_LRG-600x461.jpg" alt="" title="1342top_LRG" width="600" height="461" class="alignright size-large wp-image-61434" /></a></p>
<p>Technical Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight: 19.78g</li>
<li>Dimensions: 34.33mm / 1.35&#8243; x 138.41mm / 5.44&#8243;</li>

Winkleman Gallery is very pleased to present Nano-Nonobjective-Oriented Ontographs and Qubit-Built Quilts,our third solo exhibition by New York artist Shane Hope.Featuring two series of new work, the exhibition runs March 29 through May 4, 2013. In the gallery project space, we will also present a selection of Hope&rsquo;s “Folk-Computronium Laptops.”</p>
<p>Accelerating progress in nanometer-scale science and technology continues to expand the toolkit with which we can eventually assemble things from the atom up. This will potentially give rise to nearly costless systems for controlling the structure of matter itself. In the interim, the 3D printing revolution is said to have already arrived, promising content-to-print solutions and on-demand means of increasingly customizable production. But molecular manufacturing and 3D printing won&rsquo;t merely make for an end to material scarcity as we know it. These so-called “abundance” technologies will make for objecthoods the likes of which we&rsquo;ve not known and maybe can&rsquo;t know this side of some sort of technological singularity (i.e, the theoretical emergence of superintelligence through technological means beyond which events cannot be predicted). It&rsquo;s in anticipation of that reality race that Shane Hope&rsquo;s work starts.
