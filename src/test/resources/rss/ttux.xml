			<title>Java 1.8 (JDK8): What's new? Code examples and performance</title>
			<link>http://ttux.net/post/java-8-new-features-release-performance-code</link>
			<description>In a previous post, I talked about <a href="/post/java-7-new-release-performance-code/">new features and performance of java 1.7</a>. Java 7 has now been released a while ago and Java 8 is coming. Java 1.8 is planned to be released on the 9th of September 2013. I'm going to present the main new features of the Java 8 (JDK8). I will show some code examples and run some simple benchmarks to compare it with its predecessor Java 1.6 and Java 1.7.</description>

			<title>How to get webex to work on Linux?</title>
			<link>http://ttux.net/post/webex-linux-how-to</link>
			<description>A company I work for is using <a href="http://www.webex.com/">webex</a> for audio/video conferencing. Webex say they support linux and more specifically Ubuntu 10x, Red Hat (5/6), Open SuSE (11.3/11.4) and Fedora (13/14) with Firefox 3.x, 4.x, 5.x. As I am using Arch Linux and I don't want to use a virtual machine, I have been trying to get it to work on it. As we all know, any linux distributions is pretty much the same thing so if it works on 1 distribution it should be possible to get it to work on any other. So let's see how to get webex to work on Linux in general and Arch Linux in particular.</description>

			<link>http://ttux.net/post/regexp-validate-email-regexp-replace</link>
			<description>regexp or in other words regular expression is something you have to regularly use in your applications. I've decided to write this post as a placeholder for regexp I believe are common and useful such as regexp for email validation or some you might use to replace characters in a string. I might write some piece of java code but you can use these regular expression in many other languages.</description>

			<title>Clear memory caches on Linux</title>
			<link>http://ttux.net/post/clear-memory-cache-linux</link>
			<description>You have a machine with a lot of RAM. After sometimes you notice that you have hardly any RAM left and that it starts to swap. Though if you look at your process using top for example you notice that none of your application are using all your memory. This is because Linux is caching stuff into memory and unfortunately when you need to use more memory rather than freeing some cache it will start to swap. So let's see how to clear the memory cache.</description>

			<title>How to: postfix, dovecot with imap, smtp sasl authentication, encryption</title>
			<link>http://ttux.net/post/postfix-dovecot-sasl-authentication-smtp-imap-spamassassin</link>
			<description>This is a great how-to if you want to install and configure an email server. If you are struggling to do so, this post will put an end to it. I myself was struggling getting everything to work as I wanted especially for the smtp to do authentication and solve the relay access denied error message I was getting even with the authentication working. On top of having a working email server with encryption and authentication we will configure spamassassin in order to get rid of the SPAM. Configuration files are available for download and it is guarantee to work not like the thousand of tutorials I read.</description>

			<title>Install linux on a eeepc 1000he</title>
			<link>http://ttux.net/post/install-linux-eeepc-1000he-archlinux-kernel-config</link>
			<description><p>I came across a eeepc 1000he over christmas where I had to install Linux (more precisely Archlinux). It was for my brother who wanted to try Linux and use it for his work. That gave me the idea for my previous post "<a href="http://inebium.com/post/discover-install-try-linux-archlinux">Discover, install and try a new Linux distribution: archlinux</a>". Indeed I didn't know any real good tutorial for archlinux when someone never used Linux before. As he managed to install Archlinux few problems remained: the touchpad was not working perfectly and the hardware acceleration for compiz was not working out of the box. So I decided, as I wanted him to have a good experience with Linux, to create a good kernel config and compile the kernel myself as well as make a good xorg.conf (I am not a big fan of the AutoAddDevices as things don't work really perfectly for a specific machine).</p></description>

			<title>How to create a webapp? A step by step tutorial about the springframework, maven and eclipse.</title>
			<link>http://ttux.net/post/create-webapp-java-spring-maven-eclipse</link>

I will do a short introduction about maven as we will use it. The IDE I am using is eclipse so if you don't already know about it, you can learn few things there.</description>
